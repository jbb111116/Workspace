            <h3>Position and Velocity</h3>
            <p>Velocity is just the total displacement or change in position that a particle has traveled over a period of time. dX/dt = V in calculus terms</p>

            <h3>Velocity and Acceleration</h3>
            <p>Acceleration is the change in velocity that a particle has experienced over a period of time. dV/dt = A in calculus terms</p>

            <h3>Position and Acceleration</h3>
            <p>Acceleration is the double derivative of position. d^2(X)/dt^2 = A in calculus terms</p>
